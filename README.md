# GPT API Client

This PyQt5 application serves as a simple client for interacting with a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) API. It allows users to input a query and receive a response from the API.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the necessary dependencies (`PyQt5`, `requests`, `qdarkstyle`). You can install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 requests qdarkstyle
Run the gpt_client.py script:
bash
Copy code
python gpt_client.py
Enter your query in the provided text field.
Click the "Send Request" button to fetch a response from the GPT API.
Optionally, you can copy the response to clipboard by clicking the "Copy Response" button.
Dependencies
PyQt5: Provides the GUI framework for the application.
requests: Used for making HTTP requests to the GPT API.
qdarkstyle: Provides a dark theme for the application interface.
